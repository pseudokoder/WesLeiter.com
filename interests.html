      Interests and Hobbies
    </h2>
    <p>
      I've had quite an interesting and extensive exposure to the world through my
      time in the United States Army.  Through my experiences, I've learned that I
      want to pursue a highly technical career in the field of Software Engineering
      and Programming.  My fascination with computers began at an early age, when
      my Dad brought home our very first desktop computer.  It was an i286, and I
      loved having him show me the things that he would be working on.  Later, while
      I was in the Army, I met a friend who taught me how to choose and build my own
      computer hardware from scratch.  I’ve been building my own desktop computers
      since then just for fun, but it wasn’t until I had my friends asking me why
      I don’t just study computers in college and make a career out of my interests
      that I decided to look deeper into it.  After some research, I realized there
      wasn’t much business in simply building computers any more so I decided to see
      what other areas of the computer world might interest me.  I took a class on
      intro to programming and algorithms using the C language and I loved every bit
      of it.  So, I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science.  And that’s how
      I turned my interests and hobby into a budding career.
