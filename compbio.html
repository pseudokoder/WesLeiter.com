      Computing Biography

    <h3>
      Programming Experience
    </h3>
    <p>
      I first started programming after enrolling in an introduction to
      computing and algorithms class at Sacramento City College.  It was so much fun,
      I decided to major in it.
      Since then, I've been attending CSU, Chico and I've completed all the lower
      division programming and algorithms courses as shown below.

    <h3>
      Web Development Experience
    </h3>
    <p>
      I’ve always thought web development might be fun, so a few years ago I finally
      decided to buy my own domain and start practicing by designing my own website,
      <a href="http://wesleiter.com/" target="_blank">
        wesleiter.com
      </a>.
      &nbsp;&nbsp; I took a brief introductory course online from one of those,
      “learn to design web pages for free” sites and got started.  I was able to
      design my home page and get an idea of what I wanted it to look like, but
      then life happened, I got distracted and deployed overseas for the Army and
      well, I thought, “what better way to get motivated again than to take a web
      design class.”  So here I am, and this Personal Biography project fits perfectly
      into my plans to finish designing my own site I started so long ago.  I plan
      to use what I learn in this class by applying it to further enhance my own
			website and my family’s website that my Dad started long ago,

        Leiters.org
      </a>.
